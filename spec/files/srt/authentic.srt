few missing during the last attack.

for a minute.

No.

Yes. Yes.

I used to work with him
at the Ministry of Defense.

198
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:19,745
It says here that he's uncovered
important information...

199
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:23,482
regarding how the Cylons were
able to defeat colonial defenses.

200
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,615
I was always a little worried
he was on to us.

201

Were you going
to speak to him?

202
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:30,528
Perhaps I should speak to him
if you're busy.

203
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:34,726
Actually, I think he wanted to
speak directly with the President.

204
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,461
It sounded urgent.

205
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,661
It must be very important.

206
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,942
Maybe something about a certain
traitor in the President's inner circle?

before we jump.

Tell him to set up a combat

Okay. Let's set up

You know, the truth is...

You look that way, too.

Don't start.

as good as you are.

If the crew doesn't hate the

Good. So do I.

Thank the gods you're with us.

If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.

00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:11,577
I don't think
they got the message, Apollo.

Yeah, I see it. Boomer, break
wireless silence on my authority.

Warn them to stop their
engines immediately.

498
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:23,556
I suggest that we evacuate the
passengers and destroy the ship.

499
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:26,226
It solves the problem
if they're tracking the ship.
